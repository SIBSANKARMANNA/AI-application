# AI Integration Web Application

## Project Overview

This web application demonstrates the integration of AI features, such as sentiment analysis and content recommendation, alongside an admin dashboard. The platform allows users to access personalized content and provides the ability for administrators to manage users and their roles. The app includes functionalities like registration, login, password reset, and role-based access control to different sections based on user roles (Admin or User).

### Features:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Users can analyze the sentiment of text inputs, which helps in identifying whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Content Recommendation**: Based on user input, the system recommends personalized content tailored to user preferences.
- **Profile Section**: Every user can view and update their profile, including their profile picture, name, and email.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin users can manage all users on the platform, view user details (name, email, and profile picture), and delete users when necessary.
- **Create Admin Section**: Admins can create other admin users in addition to normal users.
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin users have access to the admin dashboard and user management functions, while normal users can only access the profile, sentiment analysis, and content recommendation features.
- **Registration and Login**: New users can sign up and existing users can log in with email and password.
- **Password Reset**: Users can reset their password if they forget it.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **User Security**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and bcryptjs for password hashing.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrated AI model for text sentiment classification.
- **Content Recommendation**: Algorithm-based content recommendation.
